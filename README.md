# Jank-Space-Engine
An unfinished engine which can roughly simulate the effects of gravity. I thought it would be an interesting side project.

### Features
- Roughly accurate simulation of gravity for all of the objects in the simulation
- A timescale factor, for slowing down or speeding up simulation speed
